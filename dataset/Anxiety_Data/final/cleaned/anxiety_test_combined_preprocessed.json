    "figurative_reasoning": "1. **Cause-effect**: - Cause: The character is initially feeling fine with life. - Effect: The mental illness resurfaces unexpectedly. 2. **Figurative Understanding**: - The meme uses the mailbox as a metaphor for the sudden and unexpected resurfacing of mental illness. The mailbox represents a place where important messages (in this case, the mental illness) are supposed to be stored and managed, but instead, it is left open, allowing the messages to flood in unexpectedly. - The humor lies in the irony of the situation, where the character is feeling stable and then suddenly faces a mental health crisis, highlighting the unpredictable nature of mental illness. 3. **Mental State**: - The character is experiencing a mix of emotions, including relief, stability, and sudden anxiety or distress when the mental illness resurfaces. The meme captures the vulnerability and unpredictability of living with mental health conditions."

This irony highlights the absurdity of the phrase in the context of a villain, suggesting that the \"light\" might not be as comforting as it seems. 3. **Mental State**: The meme depicts a state of anxiety or skepticism, as the viewer is presented with a humorous and ironic twist on the optimistic phrase.

The humor lies in the irony that the character's efforts to avoid judgment result in being ignored, highlighting the often counterintuitive nature of social interactions. 3. **Mental State**: - The character's mental state includes anxiety, self-doubt, and a desire for acceptance. The character's actions reflect a struggle between wanting to be judged and wanting to avoid judgment, which ultimately leads to feelings of being ignored and possibly even more anxiety."

The humor lies in the irony that despite doing the bare minimum, one still deserves a good night's sleep. 3. **Mental State**: - The meme depicts a state of relaxation and contentment, as the person is enjoying sleep after a long day of minimal effort.

    "figurative_reasoning": "1. **Cause-effect**: The meme suggests that the person is experiencing a high level of stress, which is humorously compared to the stress level of Britney Spears in 2007. The cause is the person's current state of anxiety, and the effect is the comparison to Britney's well-known stress levels during that period. 2. **Figurative Understanding**: The meme uses a metaphor where the person's stress level is compared to that of Britney Spears in 2007, a time when she was known for her high-stress public persona. This comparison is ironic and humorous, as it exaggerates the person's stress to an extreme level, suggesting that their stress is as intense as Britney's during a particularly stressful period in her life. 3. **Mental State**: The mental state depicted in the meme is one of high anxiety and stress. The person is likely feeling overwhelmed and possibly anxious, as indicated by the expression and the act of holding a phone, which could symbolize seeking help or trying to communicate their feelings."

    "figurative_reasoning": "1. **Cause-effect**: The cause is the person's initial happiness or contentment, as indicated by the speech bubble saying \"Are you finally enjoying life.\" The effect is the person's subsequent anxiety and fear, as expressed in the second speech bubble, \"Yes now shut up,\" and the third speech bubble, \"What if every single thing going well for you is a mere facade. No one loves you or truly will. They will leave when they learn too much.\" 2. **Figurative Understanding**: The meme uses the brain as a metaphor for the person's inner thoughts and anxieties. The brain's exaggerated expressions and the person's reaction to it symbolize the internal struggle with self-doubt and fear of rejection. The humor lies in the irony of the brain's exaggerated concerns, which are often overblown and unrealistic. 3. **Mental State**: The mental state depicted includes happiness or contentment (initial state), anxiety and fear (subsequent state), and self-doubt (ongoing state). The person is experiencing a cycle of positive emotions followed by intense negative thoughts, which is a common pattern in anxiety disorders."

This implies that the person is dealing with anxiety or stress related to planning and anticipating potential negative outcomes. - (Cause) Overwhelming anxiety about worst case scenarios. - (Effect) Seeking a simpler solution like a vision board. 2. **Figurative Understanding**: The meme uses a visual metaphor where the person is reaching out to a butterfly, symbolizing a desire to grasp or control something abstract and uncontrollable. The butterfly represents the idea of \"worst case scenarios,\" which are often seen as fleeting and unpredictable. The vision board, on the other hand, is a tangible and structured tool for planning and goal setting. The humor lies in the irony that the person is more comfortable with a vision board, which is a more concrete and achievable goal, rather than dealing with the anxiety of worst case scenarios. - (Metaphor) The butterfly represents worst case scenarios, which are unpredictable and fleeting. - (Symbolism) The vision board represents a structured and achievable goal, symbolizing a simpler and more concrete solution to anxiety. 3. **Mental State**: The person in the meme appears to be in a state of anxiety and overwhelm.
