The label \"*depressed parkour*\" symbolizes the rapid and dramatic change in mood, likening it to the physical agility and speed required in parkour.\n3. **Mental State**: The meme depicts a state of depression, characterized by sudden and intense emotional distress, as indicated by the person's exaggerated physical expression and the label \"*depressed parkour*\"."

The cause is the \"killer\" (Tom) holding a knife, and the effect is the \"me\" (Jerry) being in a vulnerable position, ready to be killed.\n   \n2. **Figurative Understanding**: The meme uses the classic Tom and Jerry cartoon to symbolize a situation of depression and suicide. The \"killer\" (Tom) represents the internal or external forces that lead to suicidal thoughts, while the \"me\" (Jerry) represents the person struggling with depression. The humor lies in the irony that the \"killer\" (Tom) is also the \"me\" (Jerry), suggesting that the person is their own \"killer.\" The knife represents the act of suicide, and the \"me\" (Jerry) being in a vulnerable position symbolizes the helplessness and despair of depression.\n\n3. **Mental State**: The meme captures the mental state of someone experiencing depression, where they feel trapped, helpless, and ready to end their life. The \"me\" (Jerry) is in a state of fear and vulnerability, while the \"killer\" (Tom) is in a state of aggression and determination to end the \"me\" (Jerry).

The verbal abuse received by the person in the car represents a stark contrast to this ideal, suggesting that the person in the house is not living up to this commandment.\n   - **Symbolism:** The car represents a barrier or a physical distance between the person and the house, symbolizing the emotional or psychological distance between the person and the person in the house.\n   - **Irony:** The irony lies in the fact that the person in the car is following a commandment to love their neighbor, but is met with hostility, highlighting the disconnect between the ideal and reality.\n\n3. **Mental State:**\n   - **Mental State of the Person in the Car:** The person in the car is likely feeling confused, surprised, and possibly hurt by the hostile response, as they were following a commandment to be kind.\n   - **Mental State of the Person in the House:** The person in the house is likely feeling angry, resentful, or bitter, as indicated by the abusive language used in response to the greeting.\n\nThese triples capture the essence of the meme, highlighting the contrast between the ideal of kindness and the reality of hostility, as well as the emotional states of the individuals involved."

This indicates a cycle where attempts to improve or recover from a negative state lead to further deterioration.\n\n2. **Figurative Understanding**: \n   - The meme uses the metaphor of \"recovery\" as a physical or mental process, suggesting that the person is trying to heal or improve their condition. However, the outcome is ironic, as the process itself leads to a worsening of the situation. This could symbolize the difficulty in overcoming depression or other mental health issues, where even well-intentioned efforts can backfire.\n\n3. **Mental State**: \n   - The person depicted in the image appears to be in a state of distress or despair, as indicated by their posture and the overall somber tone of the image. The mental state is one of hopelessness or frustration, as they are struggling with the idea that their efforts to recover are not yielding positive results."

The meme humorously extends this to Valentine's Day, implying that the person is being neglected or forgotten, which is ironic given the holiday's focus on love and affection.\n\n3. **Mental State**: The meme depicts a mental state of loneliness, unlovedness, and possibly sadness or frustration.

Just as the drain is ineffective in managing the water, the person's response (\"don't be sad\") is ineffective in managing the person's depression. The humor lies in the irony that the drain, which is supposed to help, is actually exacerbating the problem.\n3. **Mental State**: The meme depicts the mental state of depression, where the person is feeling overwhelmed and unable to cope with their emotions.

The irony lies in the idea that the person is now seen as \"responsible,\" which might be seen as a positive change, but the humor comes from the exaggerated and somewhat absurd nature of the shift.\n3. **Mental State**: The individual in the meme appears to be in a state of complacency or apathy in 2019, as indicated by the label \"LAZY BASTARD.\" In 2020, the individual seems to have adopted a more conscientious and responsible mental state, as indicated by the label \"RESPONSIBLE ADULT.\""
