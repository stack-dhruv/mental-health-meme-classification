It suggests that people only care about you if you fit into a narrow set of criteria (beautiful, popular, or dead), which is ironic and humorous.\n   - **Symbolism**: The phrase \"nobody cares\" is a stark statement that underscores the emptiness of superficial relationships, while the list of criteria (beautiful, popular, or dead) symbolizes the superficiality and lack of genuine connection.\n\n3. **Mental State**:\n   - **Emotional State**: The meme evokes feelings of loneliness, isolation, and the realization that true care is rare and often conditional.

        "figurative_reasoning": "1. **Cause-effect**: The cause is the question \"So what's your job?\" posed by someone, and the effect is the person's response, which is \"Professional Overthinker.\" This suggests that the person is struggling with self-identification and possibly feels inadequate or misunderstood in their professional context.\n   \n2. **Figurative Understanding**: The meme uses the metaphor of a \"Professional Overthinker\" to humorously represent the internal struggle of someone who is deeply analytical and prone to overthinking. The label is placed on the person's chest, symbolizing the burden of their thoughts and the difficulty in expressing their true self in a straightforward manner. The humor lies in the irony that the person is being asked about their job, which is a common social interaction, but their response is a reflection of their internal state rather than a direct answer to the question.\n\n3. **Mental State**: The mental state depicted in the meme is one of self-doubt, anxiety, and possibly depression. The person is struggling with their identity and the pressure to present themselves in a way that aligns with societal expectations. The label \"Professional Overthinker\" highlights the person's tendency to overanalyze situations, which can lead to feelings of isolation and inadequacy."
